# Kind Shim Deployment
This example shows how one could deploy the Spin shim and use them locally using Kind. The example consists of the following files.

```
$ tree .
.
├── Dockerfile
├── DockerSetup.md
└── README.md
```

- **Dockerfile:** is the specification for the image run as a Kubernetes node within the Kind cluster. We add the shim to the `/usr/local/bin` directory and add the containerd config.

## How to run the example
The shell script below will create a Kind cluster locally with the Spin shim installed and containerd configured. The script then applies the runtime classes for the shim and an example service and deployment. Finally, after port-forwarding the service, we curl the `/hello` and receive a response from the example workload.
```shell
docker build -t kind-shim-test deployments/kind
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --name wasm-cluster --image kind-shim-test --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
containerdConfigPatches:
- |-
	[plugins."io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime".containerd.runtimes.spin]
	   runtime_type = "io.containerd.spin.v2"
	[plugins."io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime".containerd.runtimes.spin.options]
	   SystemdCgroup = true
EOF
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinframework/containerd-shim-spin/raw/main/deployments/workloads/runtime.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinframework/containerd-shim-spin/raw/main/deployments/workloads/workload.yaml
echo "waiting 15 seconds for workload to be ready"
sleep 15
kubectl port-forward svc/wasm-spin 8081:80 &
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8081/hello
```

To tear down the cluster, run the following.
```shell
kind delete cluster --name wasm-cluster
```

## How build get started from source
Go to the root of the repository and run the following commands.
```shell
make up
```
